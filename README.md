# Arcane CPP
Arcane CPP or Arcane C++ is an object oriented programming language designed around the concept of building spells using abstraction and dot notation. It's a lot like making a C++ program for spells, but furthered beyond. 

## Inspiration
I was inspired to make this because of [this](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/183368/magic-as-a-programming-language) post on the World Building Stack Exchange.

## Documentation 
Documentation will be in the wiki of this repository and will be updated continuously as I develop the language.

## To-Do
- Tokenizer
- Figure out primitives
